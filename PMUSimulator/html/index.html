<h1><a class="anchor" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>
INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p >Wide area monitoring system (WAMS) is now a mature technology and is being increasingly adopted in transmission networks worldwide. It provides synchronous measurements of phasors, analog quantities and digital signals at data rates of typically once per power frequency cycle. This translates to 50 or 60 frames per second depending on the system frequency where Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) are installed. The phasors can be estimated from directly measured quantities like three-phase voltages and currents or derived quantities like positive, negative and zero sequence components. This arrangement works fine when the main purpose is system monitoring. Applications like state estimations, oscillation mode monitoring, line parameters estimations and instrument transformer calibrations etc. are successfully deployed using phasor measurements.</p>
<p >The current version of the IEEE Std. C37.118.1 requires the calculation of synchrophasors within defined accuracy limits in steady state conditions. During transient conditions, the accuracy limits of steady state do not apply. The standard only defines length of the time up to which the transient periods can last after step changes in phase, magnitude and frequency. It is possible that PMUs of different vendors report different values of synchrophasors during transient conditions.</p>
<p >Calculation of phasor makes assumptions regarding the wave shapes of the input signals. All information in the signal except fundamental frequency component is lost in the process of phasor calculation. In many situations line the analysis of a fault event and investigating protection system performance, it is important to get the actual wave shapes of the signals rather than just their phasor values.</p>
<p >Digital signals like circuit breaker positions can change within a fraction of a cycle, hence the time resolution of one cycle provided in the existing infrastructure is not so useful in determining the sequence of events on a wide-area basis. Local substation-wide sequence of events are generally available through disturbance records of protection system. However, determining the system-wide sequence of event development for analysing a system wide event is a challenging task.</p>
<p >Usually instantaneous samples of all electrical quantities i.e., voltages and currents measured at transmission network are already sampled in PMUs using synchronous sampling as it is a necessary step in calculation of synchronous phasors. However, transmitting instantaneous values continuously in time is a costly proposition with respect to communication bandwidth, storage capacity and computational resources.</p>
<p >From power system point of view, it serves little purpose to get these measurements in near real time from sensors deployed over a wide area. The latency involved in obtaining data from wide area to central location make is useless for most of equipment protection purposes. The slower wide area control applications do not require instantaneous point on wave values, as they generally use phasor values.</p>
<p >On the other hand, during power system faults or a power system events like opening or closing of a transmission line, transformer or synchronizing a generator, it will be of great help if synchronously sampled instantaneous values of these measurements are available for the post-disturbance analysis. These measurements need not be real time or near real time. A delay of few seconds between the events and data availability at a central location is tolerable.</p>
<p >This project is a midway solution that gives all the advantages of high resolution measurements, and at the same time does not put much stress on the communication and computational infrastructure. We also leverage most of the existing technologies to achieve these objectives with little bit of extension of their capabilities. The project allows us to get the synchronously measured instantaneous data with consistent naming and other associated meta-data along with digital signals measured over a wide area at a central location in as seamless manner, and present it for post event analysis in case of a fault or any other power system event.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="Extensions_of_PMU_capabilities"></a>
Extensions_of_PMU_capabilities</h1>
<p >The first step is to extend the computation capabilities of PMU. The capabilities have to be extended to also store the instantaneous samples that were used for calculating phasors. These samples are captured in a synchronous manner for all channels and stored in a circular buffer as First in First out (FIFO) manner for a duration of about a few tens of seconds. The duration of data that is stored in the buffer can be configurable. In practice, a duration about 30 seconds is sufficient. The sampling frequency for instantaneous samples is usually much higher in range of 20 to 80 samples per power frequency cycle, which is compatible with the requirements of high resolution point on wave data.</p>
<p >The second step is to have the capability to receive a signal from Phasor Data Concentrator (PDC) that commands to send instantaneous point on wave sampled values. Upon receiving the command a PMU make a COMTRADE file as per C37.111-2013 binary format. This file contains instantaneous values for time 30 second prior and 30 second later to the time stamp of the command frame. Hence, the data stored in the buffer is used to get the instantaneous values of signal prior to the command and data is collected for further 30 second time after the command is received. So total duration of data in a single COMTRADE file is 60 seconds.</p>
<p >IEEE Std C37.111-2013 defines the formats for files for storing data generated by various power systems or power system models. This common format is called Common Format for Transient Data Exchange (COMTRADE). Each COMTRADE record can have up to four associated files. viz, header, configuration, data and information. All four files have the same name with different extensions to indicate the type of file. All the four files can also be combined as a single file with an extension CFF. Here we utilize only configuration and data files of COMTRADE. The channel names in configuration file of COMTRADE files may be taken from channel names used in CFG frame of the PMU or there can be a facility to define unique names for this purpose.</p>
<p >Generally float32 data type in primary values can be selected in the data file of COMTRADE to use the full resolution available in the standard, as there can be a wide range of data when handling instantaneous values of signals. This also avoids the requirements of determining maximum and minimum value of each signal to be added in the COMTRADE configuration file.</p>
<p >The timestamps of data samples need to be synchronized as is the case with PMU frames.</p>
<p >Finally, the PMU must be able to send this COMTRADE file as a new frame which is extension to C37_118_2. There are two new frames required, one for COMTRADE configuration file and the other for COMTRADE data file. Both the frames must have the same timestamp to indicate an association between them. CHK bits are also attached at the end of these frames to ensure verification of data integrity at PDC end. These frames are sent to PDC following the usual framework of sending DATA frame. Another important feature that must be supported by PMU is that the instantaneous value COMTRADE data frames should be sent with a random delay of few seconds. A PMU should be constrained to respond to just one command for instantaneous point on wave data request at a time. It should ignore or not respond to a new request until data for the active command is sent.</p>
<p >The implementation of these extensions must be such that the usual functioning of PMU i.e, responding to normal commands from PDC and sending data frames at the regular data frame rate is not disturbed.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="Extensions_of_PDC_capabilities"></a>
Extensions_of_PDC_capabilities</h1>
<p >Some changes are also required at the PDC side too. The first change in PDC is to have the ability to send a new command frame that indicates a command to the PMU to send instantaneous point on wave data. The second change is to have the ability to receive two new types of data frames that contain COMTRADE data and configuration files sent by PMU.</p>
<p >The PDC can be programmed to send a command for instantaneous values when it receives an trigger event in data frames of any one of the PMU. From the point of view of power system events and to get best utilization of the new features it is required that the command for instantaneous values is sent to all PMUs reporting to the PDC or few PMUs in the neighbourhood of the PMU that triggered the event. This ensures that 60 second synchronized instantaneous point on wave data is available system-wide. <br  />
</p>
<p >It is generally possible that for a given power system event, more than one PMU send an event trigger. Hence, the PDC should respond to just one of the trigger and ignore rest of the triggers for next 30 seconds. If any trigger is present beyond that time, a new command for instantaneous values is sent to all PMUs. Hence, there is always at least 30 second time difference between two commands for instantaneous values. This avoids overwhelming the communication network and PMUs with frequent requests of instantaneous values.</p>
<p >After sending a command for instantaneous values, the PDC must await to receive the responses from PMUs for COMTRADE files. Once a frame is received, it is parsed and the trigger time is extracted from the configuration file. This time is matched with the timestamp of the command that was sent earlier. This step ensures the association between the command from PDC and the response from the PMU. The received COMTRADE file is stored at appropriate location with a unique identity derived from PMUID, STN and timestamp of the command i.e., SOC and FRACSEC. A wait time of few minutes can be configured for which the PDC will wait to receive COMTRADE files from PMUs. Further data parsing is not performed after the wait time is expired. The CRC bits are also verified at PDC ends and only valid files are stored. <br  />
</p>
<p >It can be programmed that PMUs send these files in TCP protocol so as to ensure confirmed delivery to PDC. Even though all PMUs would send the COMTRADE data frames, they would be received in a time spread manner as each PMU is programmed to have a random delay while sending the data. Hence, there is moderate stress on communication bandwidth. The normal working of PDC is not disturbed while it receives the COMTRADE files.</p>
<p >In this way system-wide high resolution instantaneous point on wave data is collected at PDC end for any event of power system network. The data is received within few minutes of the event, which is compatible with this type of data as it is mostly used for post processing and human consumption.</p>
<p >The next section gives details of exact extensions done to the standard C37_118_2. In most of the places, the facility of user definable bits provided in the standard is used.</p>

<p >IEEE Standard C37.118.2-2011 is the standard for Synchrophasor Data Transfer for Power Systems. The standard defines the methods of real time exchange of synchronized measurement data between PMU, PDC, and other applications using any suitable communication protocol.</p>
<p >The standard defines</p>
<ul>
<li>Types of messages, its contents and use </li>
<li>Data types and formats </li>
<li>Communication options and requirements</li>
</ul>
<p>This standard enables exchange of data among measurement, data collection, and application equipment. It defines a simple, defined, open access method for data transmission and storage within a phasor measurement system.</p>
<p >The PMUs communicate with PDCs or other higher level devices using four types of frames defined in the standard. Data frame, Configuration frame 1,2 and 3, Header frame and Command frame. The basic communication flow is as shown here </p><div class="image">

<h2><a class="anchor" id="Instantaneous_values_frames"></a>
Instantaneous_values_frames</h2>
<p >Two new frames have been defined as an extension to the existing standard. Instantaneous values configuration frame and instantaneous values data frame.</p>
<p >Bits 6-4 of the SYNC word in the frames is used to distinguish between various kinds of frames. Some bit combinations specified in the table below are defined in the standard to indicate frame types. A new frame type of configuration frame 3 was added in 2011 version of the standard C37_118_2, it was not present in the 2005 version. In the same way 110 and 111 can be used to indicate that the frame is an instantaneous values configuration frame and instantaneous values data frame respectively </p><ul>

<p>The COMTRADE files created by PMU in response to the command for instantaneous values are embedded in the new frames. Except for SYNC word bits 6-4, the other 14 bytes at the beginning of the frame are as per the word definitions common to all frame types mentioned in Table-2 of C37_118_2. The last two bytes are also calculated from the rest of the frame and added as CHK bytes. The body of frames is formed by the contents of COMTRADE configuration and data files respectively.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="Instantaneous_values_configuration_frame"></a>
Instantaneous_values_configuration_frame</h3>
<p >The COMTRADE configuration file is embedded in this frame. This frame is similar to the CFG-2 frame. Bits 6-4 in the SYNC word is 110 to indicate that its a DR configuration frame. </p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="Instantaneous_values_data_frame"></a>
Instantaneous_values_data_frame</h3>
<p >Bits 6-4 in the SYNC word is 111 to indicate that its a instantaneous values data frame. The content of COMTRADE files include time stamps in SOC and FRACSEC for all instantaneous samples of all channels given, instantaneous samples of all digital channels and various internally generated binary signals to indicate status of PMU and time synchronizing, similar to that given in data frames in C37_118_2. Due to the large size of the data file, the .DAT file is split into parts with size less than 65535 bytes and each part is embedded and sent in a frame that is similar to configuration frame 3. The CONT_ID of the last file is to be set as 65535 to indicate that its the last part of the file. Sufficient delay is to be given before the last file is sent to ensure that all other parts have been received at the receiving end before the last part is received, as there is no indication of the total numbers of parts of instantaneous values data frame to be expected from PMU.</p>
<p >The size of the instantaneous values configuration file is not large but the instantaneous values data file may be substantially higher, in the order of megabytes. The instantaneous values data file has to be split into smaller files before it is sent and has to reassembled at the receiving end. Since a large number of files are sent and the guaranteed arrival of all the parts is essential for the integrity of the whole file, this can be reliably transmitted over TCP. On the receiving end, the file has to be reassembled using the CONT_ID.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="Command_Frames"></a>

<p >A new command frame to request all connected PMUs to send instantaneous values frames have been defined. Bits 15-0 if the command frame are used to identify different command frames. <br  />

<p >All the extensions described in the sections could also be achieved by using the extended frame data in command frame according to Table 14 of C37_118_2. However, it is to be noted that we have not used the extended frame facility. This is to maintain the convention that it is only PDC that sends commands to PMUs. The PMUs are generally acting as a devices that responds to commands by giving data frames and configuration frames as required by PDC.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="Summary_and_Conclusion"></a>
Summary_and_Conclusion</h1>
<p >For high resolution data functionality, it is proposed that PMUs have extended capability to maintain a buffer of the instantaneous samples that were used for calculating phasors. Extended PMUs are able to accept a command frame, sent by a PDC, to execute a command to send instantaneous values data. Upon receiving the command, PMUs make a COMTRADE files. This file includes instantaneous values for time 30 seconds prior and 30 seconds later to the time stamp of the command frame. Extended PDCs accept the instantaneous values, configuration and data frames and store them.</p>
<p >The importance of such a system was felt in events like a partial black out experienced in the city of Mumbai in India in month of October 2020. One of the main triggers events was the overvoltage observed at a 400 kV substations. The disturbance records of only a few of the relays were available, as event recording due to overvoltage was not configured in all relays. If high resolution synchronous data were available from all PMUs it would have been of great help in post event analysis.</p>
<p >The system proposed in this paper results in a streamlined synchronous wide area disturbance record of an event in quick time. It is necessary that the proposed mechanism is followed by all PMUs and PDCs in the WAMS system, hence an update in the existing communication standard is sought.</p>

      If you need to run simulator on different from iPDC machine then Copy the PMU Simulator on that machine.
      Single installation of PMU Simulator will work in case you need to simulate multiple PMUSimulator on the same machine.

              1. cd /PATH/iPDC.x.y/PMUSimulator.x.y
              2. make install 
              3. Run - PMU via terminal or you could found its shortcut on menu name PMU Simulator.

USAGE</h2>
<pre class="fragment"> i) When iPDC acts as a Client -&gt;

         1. Run DBServer on terminal of the machine where DBServer is installed. This will be listening on port 9000 for data &amp; CFG frames from iPDC.

         2. Run PMU Simulator in the machine where PMUSimulator is installed. You can run the PMU Simulator from anywhere in the system. Enter the PMU Port numbers for TCP and UDP. Port should be other than 9000, as 9000 is used by DBServer. 

         3. Run iPDC and enter the details like TCP Port, UDP Port.
                    These are the ports on which PDC would listen to command frames from other PDC's, or applications.
                    Also enter PDC ID, that will be use for authenticate to other ends PDC's.
                    Enter the IP Address of the machine where DBServer is running. (if local, may use like 127.0.0.1)
                    Now add the PMU/Source devices by entring their minimal details.
                    As soon as the PMU details are entered, a command frame is sent to machine where the PMU/Simulator is running.
                    And communication between iPDC and PMUSimulator (PMU) will take place as follows.


      4. Communications

              1. iPDC sends a command frame to PMU, requesting its configuration.

              2. At PMU on receiving of a request for Configuration frame, PMU send back the latest configuration frame iPDC.

              3. iPDC then send a command frame to requesting PMU to start data frames transmission.

              4. PMU on reception of the command frame for send data would reply with data frames.

                      iPDC  -----------&gt;    PMU (Command to send CFG)
                      iPDC  &lt;-----------    PMU (CFG Sent)
                      iPDC  -----------&gt;    PMU (Command to send Data)
                      iPDC  &lt;-----------    PMU (Data Sent)
                      iPDC  &lt;-----------    PMU (Data Sent)
                      iPDC  &lt;-----------    PMU (Data Sent)
                      iPDC  -----------&gt;    PMU (Command to stop Data)

                     5. In the above mentioned PMU-iPDC communication, iPDC would act as a client and PMU as server.

 ii) When iPDC acts as a Server -&gt;

            When iPDC acts as a Server, it sends the combined frames (data and Configuration) to other iPDC on requesting.
            The details of these other end iPDC's need to be entered first. In this case the iPDC would work like as PMU Server.
            iPDC receives a command frames from other iPDC it would first authenticate the request.
            If the request is from authentic iPDC then combined frame would sent to respective iPDC. Remaining same as iPDC-PMU Communication.
                                                                                                                     /
            More details of the s/w can be found in the Technical Report on iPDC on the website.
